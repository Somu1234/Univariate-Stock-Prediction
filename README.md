# Univariate-Stock-Prediction
In this project, we aim to develop a LSTM based deep learning model for stock price prediction. The following methodology has been used to implement this work: ◦ Data Collection – Dataset from Yahoo Finance of AAPL (Apple) Stock Prices from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017. ◦ Preprocessing – Min-Max Scaling and Sliding Window Sequences. ◦ Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning. ◦ Model Evaluation and Selection. ◦ Prediction and Visualization
